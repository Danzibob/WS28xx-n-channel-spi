# WS28xx RGB LED SPI Driver

This crate is a driver for WS28XX (WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, WS2818) RGB LED chains/strips.
 
### About this driver

This driver was developed for a specific project where each LED module along a chain had 9 single-colour LED modules, and no available neopixel-esque driver seemed up to the task. Therefore this library can support arbitrary module sizes and doesn't reference RGB.

This driver only works on Linux systems with a SPI device, like Raspberry Pi [1]. This is needed because my driver operates at 15.6MHz. This is required because I need to reach specific *timings in nanoseconds* according to the specification while sending data [2].
WS28xx LEDs use a one wire protocol without a clock, therefore the timings during data transmission are important.

The SPI device in your Raspberry Pi has a reliable clock with high frequencies available. Regular GPIO pins **won't work!** Toggling GPIO pins takes 1Âµs (in my testing) which is *WAY TOO SLOW!* Therefore I use SPI. There is a clock device in hardware - much more reliable!

Find the `MOSI`-Pin on your device (e.g. Raspberry Pi) and connect it with `DIN`-Port of the LED. That's all what's needed.

**There is no warranty that this will work on your setup! High frequency stuff is complicated!**
